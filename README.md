##  Overview

This app simulates a real-world technical interview with a limited number of questions, a countdown timer for each, and strict navigation rules. It is ideal for practicing under pressure or as a base for HR/assessment tools.

---

##  Features

- **4 Random Interview Questions**: Pulled from a configurable `questions.json`.
- **Timed Responses**: Each question is displayed for 10 seconds, followed by 10 seconds of thinking time with a smooth background color transition.
- **Single Attempt**: The "Take Interview" button can only be clicked once; progress is persisted in `localStorage`.
- **No Cheating**: Switching tabs or windows terminates the interview permanently.
- **Route Guards**: Users cannot revisit or skip screens after completion.
- **Final Screen**: Shows completion status ("You have successfully completed the interview").
- **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Extensible**: Easily add more questions or customize logic.

##  How It Works

### Home Screen

- User sees a single **"Take Interview"** button.
- Once clicked, the interview starts, and the button is disabled (persisted via `localStorage`).

### Interview Flow

- 4 random questions shown one at a time, from `questions.json`.
- Each question appears for **10 seconds**, followed by **10 seconds** of "thinking time" with a background transition.
- Switching tabs/windows or trying to close the tab ends the interview immediately and redirects to the final screen.
- Questions are fetched via a service with no repetition.

### Final Screen

- Displays: "You have successfully completed the interview."
- Shows basic completion stats (e.g., `Questions Answered: 4/4`).
- Cannot retake the interview unless `localStorage` is cleared.

### Navigation Protection

- Route guards block access to the home or interview screens post-completion.
- Users are redirected to the final screen if they try to bypass.
